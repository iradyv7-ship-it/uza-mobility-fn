       * The React Compiler rules, deliberately at `warn` rather than `error`.
       *
       * These arrived with React 19 and flag patterns that pre-date them — chiefly
       * `setState` called synchronously inside an effect, which causes a second render
       * pass. Fourteen components in this application do it. They are worth fixing.
       *
       * They are NOT worth fixing all at once, blind, in an application that is serving
       * real customers at uzamobility.com. Each one needs its component understood and
       * its behaviour re-checked, and a batch rewrite of fourteen hooks is how a live
       * site breaks.
       *
       * So: visible on every run, tracked, and burned down deliberately — but not
       * blocking the pipeline on day one. Raise each of these to `error` as the last
       * offender in that category is fixed, which makes the ratchet one-way.
       *
       * Reviewed 30 August 2026. If this comment is more than a few months old and the
       * warning count has not moved, that is the finding.
