# Three stages so the runtime image carries the server and its traced dependencies, and
# neither the source nor the full node_modules.
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are inlined by Next at BUILD time, not read at runtime. They are
# therefore build arguments, and a different environment means a different image — which
# is also what makes the image reproducible. Nothing secret belongs in them: anything
# bundled into a browser application is public by definition.
